# Home Assistant - Wyze Bulb and Switch Integration

This is a custom component to allow control of Wyze Bulbs and Switches in Homeassistant using the unofficial Wyze API. Please note this mimics the Wyze app and therefore Wyze may cut off access at anytime.

### Highlights of what **WyzeApi** can do

* Control Wyze Bulbs as lights through HA
* Control Wyze Switches as switches through HA

## Installation (HACS) - Highly Recommended

1. Have HACS installed, this will allow you to easily update
2. Add [https://github.com/JoshuaMulliken/ha-wyzeapi](https://github.com/JoshuaMulliken/ha-wyzebulb) as a custom repository as Type: Integration
3. Click install under "Wyze Bulb and Switch Api Integration" in the Integration tab
4. Restart HA

## Installation (Manual)

1. Download this repository as a ZIP (green button, top right) and unzip the archive
2. Copy `/custom_components/wyzeapi` to your `<config_dir>/` directory
   * On Hassio the final location will be `/config/custom_components/wyzeapi`
   * On Hassbian the final location will be `/home/homeassistant/.homeassistant/custom_components/wyzeapi`
3. Restart HA

## Configuration

Add the following to your configuration file. ***Note: This has changed recently. Check your configuration!***

```yaml
wyzeapi:
  username: <email for wyze>

```

## Usage
