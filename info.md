# [Wyze Bulb and Switch Component](https://github.com/JoshuaMulliken/ha-wyzeapi) for Home Assistant

This is a custom component to allow control of Wyze Bulbs and Switches in Homeassistant using the unofficial Wyze API. Please note this mimics the Wyze app and therefore Wyze may cut off access at anytime.

## Highlights of what **WyzeApi** can do

* Control Wyze Bulbs as lights through HA
* Control Wyze Switches as switches through HA
